            <p>
              Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change [...] It
              has two major branches, differential calculus and integral
              calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and
              the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns accumulation of
              quantities, and areas under or between curves. [...] Calculus is
              used in every branch of the physical sciences, [and] in other
              fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an
              optimal solution is desired.

          <h3>The history of calculus</h3>
          <p>
            The foundations of modern calculus are commonly attributed to two
            European scholars from the 17th century: Isaac Newton and Gottfried
            Leibniz. They worked independently of each other, and arrived to
            similar conclusions by different means: Newton used the theory of
            limits, whereas Leibniz used the theory of infinitesimals. Leibniz's
            methods were easier to use, but they lacked rigorous proof &mdash;
            evidence their results were correct. Mathematicians of the time
            would more quickly develop supporting evidence for Newton's methods,
            causing Leibniz's methods to lose formal priority and relevance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1960s, mathematician Abraham Robinson developed rigorous
            proof for Leibniz's infinitesimal calculus methods. Using concepts
            from mathematical logic, Robinson formally defined the hyperreal
            number system, an extension of the real number system which includes
            infinitesimally small and infinitely large numbers. Equipped with
            supporting evidence, we can now use the infinitesimal method to
            learn and apply differential and integral calculus.
          </p>

          <h3>Why infinitesimal calculus?</h3>
          <p>
            Calculus is traditionally taught using the theory of limits; what
            are the benefits of the theory of infinitesimals? Infinitesimals are
            easier to understand and use, as the fundamental insights for
            differential and integral calculus can be derived using
            comparatively simple mathematics concepts. The remainder of this
            article will demonstrate this claim by using the theory of
            infinitesimals to solve the following two problems:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>finding the slope of the curve at a specific point</li>
            <li>finding the area under the curve over a closed interval</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Both problems will reference the following function:</p>

                  Plot of the function \(y = x^2\) and the tangent line at the
                  point \((1, 1)\).

            <p>
              The slope of a function at a specific point is equal to the slope
              of the tangent line at that point. We can calculate the slope of
              the tangent line by first calculating the slope of a secant line
              and then bringing the second point infinitesimally close to the
              desired point. Using the hyperreal number system, we can write a
              general equation for this process: \[ \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =
              \dfrac{f(x + \delta) - f(x)}{\delta} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              In this equation, \(\delta\) represents an infinitesimal, a number
              greater than 0 but smaller than any other real number.
              Substituting our function \(y = x^2\) and our point of interest
              \((1,1)\), we arrive at the following calculation: \[
              \begin{eqnarray} \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} =& \dfrac{\left(1 +
              \delta\right)^2 - 1^2}{\delta} \\ =& \dfrac{\left(1 + 2\delta +
              \delta^2\right) - 1}{\delta} \\ =& 2 + \delta \\ \end{eqnarray} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              The slope must be a real number, so we can take the real part of
              the above calculation, and our final result is \(\tfrac{\Delta
              x}{\Delta y} = 2\). You can verify this result with the following
              interactive plot, adjusting the value of \(\delta\) and seeing how
              the approximation changes.

                  Plot of the region \(A\) bounded by the function \(y = x^2\)
                  and the vertical lines \(x = 1\) and \(x = 2\).
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </article>
            <p>
              We can reconstruct the region \(A\) as the composite of infinitely
              many rectangles with width \(w = \delta\) and height \(h_i = (1 +
              i\delta)^2\). Using this definition, the area of region \(A\) is
              equal to the sum of each individual rectangle area: \[ A =
              \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(w \cdot h_i\right) \] In this equation, \(N =
              1 / \delta\) is the total number of thin rectangles; in the
              hyperreal number system, \(N\) represents an infinite number, a
              number greater than all other real numbers. More importantly, we
              can apply the same algebraic operations on \(N\) and \(\delta\) as
              with real numbers, and therefore we can decompose the sum as
              follows: \[ \begin{eqnarray} A =& \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\delta
              \cdot \left(1 + i\delta\right)^2\right) \\ =& \sum_{i=1}^{N}
              \left\{\delta \cdot \left[1 + 2i\delta +
              \left(i\delta\right)^2\right]\right\} \\ =& \sum_{i=1}^{N}
              \left(\delta + 2i\delta^2 + i^2\delta^3\right) \\ =& \delta
              \sum_{i=1}^{N} 1 + 2\delta^2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} i + \delta^3
              \sum_{i=1}^{N} i^2\\ =& N\delta + 2\delta^2\left(\tfrac{N\left(N +
              1\right)}{2}\right) + \delta^3\left(\tfrac{N(N + 1)(2N +
              1)}{6}\right) \\ =& 1 + \delta^2\left(N^2 + N\right) +
              \tfrac{\delta^3}{6}\left(2N^3 + 3N^2 + N\right) \\ =& 1 + \left(1
              + \delta\right) + \tfrac{1}{6}\left(2 + 3\delta + \delta^2\right)
              \\ =& \tfrac{7}{3} + \tfrac{3}{2}\delta + \tfrac{1}{6}\delta^2
              \end{eqnarray} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              The area must be a real number, so we take the real part of the
              above calculation as we did before, and our final result is \(A =
              \tfrac{7}{3}\). You can verify this result with the following
              interactive plot, adjusting the value of \(\delta\) and seeing how
              the approximation changes.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Although the result for the second problem required more algebraic
            manipulation than the first, we solved both using simple mathematics
            concepts. However, our solutions depend on the validity of the
            hyperreal number system, otherwise we could not apply the same
            algebraic operations on infinitesimally small and infinitely large
            quantities as we do with real numbers. Limits are the conventional
            alternative for formally defining properties of these quantities,
            but they are relatively more complicated.

            In the case of differential calculus, the general equation for the
            slope of a function is similar but strange: \[ \frac{\Delta
            y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{h\to0}\dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \] This
            definition is strange, because when \(h = 0\), then \(\Delta
            y/\Delta x = 0/0\), which is undefined. Substituting our equation
            and point from before, we would ultimately arrive at the same
            result, but the reasoning is abstracted behind the idea of \(h\)
            approaching, but never quite reaching, zero.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of integral calculus, the principles are the same, but
            without a valid representation of \(N\), the limit method requires
            computing an infinite sum: \[ A = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left(\Delta x
            \cdot \left(1 + i\Delta x\right)^2\right) \\ \] With either method
            the result is the same, but for the method of limits this stage
            requires defining the properties of infinite series, such as
            convergence and divergence &mdash; comparatively more complicated
            than the infinitesimal method.

            Calculus has important applications across science and engineering,
            and therefore calculus is a branch of mathematics worth learning. In
            honor of the importance of calculus, educational resources should
            present the topic using clear and intuitive methods. Pursuing this
            goal can require deviating from convention, but such is par the
            course for innovating and discovery.
